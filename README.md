# DRAW; A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation

DRAW is a generative model which has similar structure with VAE. But DRAW has RNN, Attention model.

DRAW wants to generate image step by step by one-shot. So they use RNN structureand attention model. The network focus small patch in total image and generate partial image.

Read operations make patch which is generated by gaussian filter. And write operations reproduce image from patch.

# Command

```
cd /path/to/src/

python3 main.py

```

if you want to make png images to gif run below command
```
cd /path/to/src/
python3 make_gif.py
```
